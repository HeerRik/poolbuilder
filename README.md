# Poolbuilder Beta
Poolbuilder is an application for creating champ select filters for the game League of Legends.

This is a project to get to know Python, as well as give a little something to the League of Legends community.
Questions about the software, aswell as suggestions, are welcome.

If you encounter any show stopping bugs, please let me know.
Bugs that result from using the software in an incorrect way, may or may not be solved some day.
A known problem is that champions inside a loaded pool still appear in the champions window, this will
be dealt with.
