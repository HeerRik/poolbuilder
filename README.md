# Poolbuilder Beta
Poolbuilder is an application for creating champ select filters for the game League of Legends.

### Instructions
For users without python 2.7:
  -  Open the 'dist' folder
  -  Run poolbuilder.exe
  -  (Optional) You could create a shortcut if you want

For users with python 2.7:
  -  Run poolbuilder.py.

### Function

The Poolbuilder application serves the purpose of creating, saving and editing champion pools.
Multiple pools can be created for multiple roles, create a pool for support, or mid or anything you want really.
Right now, the application is opened alongside a terminal, where any errors will be logged.

### Story time
This is a project to get to know Python, as well as give a little something to the League of Legends community.
Questions about the software, aswell as suggestions, are welcome.

If you encounter any show stopping bugs, please let me know.
Bugs that result from using the software in an incorrect way, may or may not be solved some day.
A known problem is that champions inside a loaded pool still appear in the champions window, this will
be dealt with.
